Assignment 0 ( pdf ) As preparation for the course projects, we present the overall system idea and the available project topics. You can already make yourself familiar with the topics, conduct some readings and collect background knowledge. This way you save time during the semester, and you can make an informed decision when selecting a topic. Furthermore, you can already start forming groups and select a corresponding project. Note: There will be no marks for this sheet, but finding a group and a project will be necessary to participate in the lab!","title":"Overview"},{"location":"assignment_overview.html#assignment-overview","text":"More information are coming soon!","title":"Assignment Overview"},{"location":"assignment_overview.html#assignment-0-pdf","text":"As preparation for the course projects, we present the overall system idea and the available project topics.
