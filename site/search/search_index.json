Assignment 0 ( pdf ) As preparation for the course projects, we present the overall system idea and the available project topics. You can already make yourself familiar with the topics, conduct some readings and collect background knowledge. This way you save time during the semester, and you can make an informed decision when selecting a topic. Furthermore, you can already start forming groups and select a corresponding project. Note: There will be no marks for this sheet, but finding a group and a project will be necessary to participate in the lab!","title":"Assignment Overview"},{"location":"assignment_overview.html#assignment-overview","text":"More information are coming soon!","title":"Assignment Overview"},{"location":"assignment_overview.html#assignment-0-pdf","text":"As preparation for the course projects, we present the overall system idea and the available project topics.

As shown in above figure, for a given programming assignment, the tutor would provide a reference solution and some test cases, while the student would submit a solution and would receive feedback for that. The feedback should go beyond the simple execution of test cases, but should tell the student where and how to fix the submission. More sophisticated and gradual ways of feedback could be also introduced. Developing such a system includes many conceptual and technical challenges. We summarized some of them into projects, from which you will need to choose one for this course. Please find below a collection of all projects, and more detailed descriptions on the following pages. We group projects by their provided functionalities.
